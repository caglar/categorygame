To run the gui run the following command:
    python cgame_gui.py
    or
    ./cgame_gui.py

If you don't want to use shell you can edit and use the catGames.py

Known Bugs:
    Issue 1: GUI plots won't draw after you have drawn one plot and try to draw the second one using the GUI. 
        Cause: Non-blocking matplotlib functions
        Solution: Use multi-threading/multi-processing
